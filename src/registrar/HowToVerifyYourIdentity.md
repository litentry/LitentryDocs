# How To Verify Your Identity

## Introduction

While the anonymity Web3 provides has a great advantage in user privacy, revealing partial personal information can help gain a higher reputation and trust in the Polkadot ecosystem. This document introduces a registrar service that is fully automatic, leveraging cryptographical design to eliminate human interventions. Litentry registrar focuses on providing judgment for a user's `display name`, `email`, `twitter`, or `element name (previously called riot)`while preserving user privacy.

We will walk through the identity verification process step by step: First, users need to set their identity information on the chain; Second, they may request the registrar to verify the identity. Users will enter a maximum fee they are willing to pay for the service. After that, the dedicated registrar can ascertain.

### Step 1: Set an on-chain identity

* Go to the 'Accounts' session on [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps)
* Make sure you're in the Kusama network by looking at the top left of the page. If not, click on the toggle to switch
* On the accounts list, click on the dots icon on the right side of your selected account and click `Set on-chain identity`.

Once everything is successfully verified, you will see your account status become "reasonable" with an ✅ icon. Congratulations - Your identity is now verified on Polkadot-JS Apps!

### Register Fee

The judgment fee of the Litentry Registrar is 0.04KSM.

It's important to notice that no KSM is sent to our registrar at any time before the judgment is completed. You should NOT send funds to our account directly. When calling `requestJudgement`, the registrar fee will be locked and put aside. It will be transferred to the registrar only after the registrar finishes its job.
